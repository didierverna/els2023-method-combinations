This is the companion code for my method combinations meta-object protocol
proposition. This work has been described in two papers:

- [Method Combinators](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3247610) (ELS 2018,
  outdated)
- [A MOP-based implementation for method
  combinations](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.7818680) (ELS 2023, more up to
  date)

There's a new paper on the way.

The protocol itself is currently available in SBCL and more recently ECL. You
can find it in my forked versions of these compilers:
- [SBCL](https://github.com/didierverna/sbcl/tree/method-combination-types).
- [ECL](https://gitlab.com/didierverna/ecl/-/tree/mc)
