;; Method combination change

;; #### NOTE: normally, we would like to do this in a before method, but SBCL
;; defines an around method on generic functions, notably with two assertions
;; checking that a generic function is not referenced by two different method
;; combinations at the same time, which would break for alternative method
;; combinations. Hence, we need to do the cleanup below first, in an around
;; method of our own. The reason SBCL does this in an around method is that it
;; compares the previous and the next method combinations, which couldn't be
;; done in before/after methods, as they would miss half of the required
;; information.
